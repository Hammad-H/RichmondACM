						<h2>We like computers and hope other people do too!</h2>
						<h3>At ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, we aim to bring students with similar interests and aspirations together and facilitate aspiring developers in getting the experience they long for.<br><br>
						Whether you're a coder, a visual designer, an analyst, or are just excited to learn, ACM is for those eager to wet their feet and delve into real development.</h3>
					</div>
					<div class= "about-text">
						<h2>Eager to develop? Then code away!</h2>
						<h3>ACM organizes a variety of real-world projects for members to engage in. With the ready assistance of senior members and initiated faculty, curious students are facilitated in learning new skills they can use in future endeavors, be it in industry, academy, or passion settings.<br><br>
						While the current topics include website and mobile application development, utilization of big data, machine learning, and open source projects, these topics are dictated by student interest and are dynamic.</h3>
					</div>
					<div class= "about-text">
						<h2>Interested in making a career?</h2>
						<h3>The job market is right around the corner, and ACM is there to make sure you're ready. Our senior members are willing to help with résumé examples and make a point to help students get to where they want to go.<br><br>
						We hold periodical resume feedback sessions, encourage students to engage in relevant projects and events, and bring speakers from various professional organizations to talk about the opportunities available, what the jobs are like, and how students can get involved/be competitive</h3>
					</div>
					<div class= "about-text">
						<h2>Get involved and do something!</h2>
						<h3>As we said, we hold quite a few special events. While some, like speakers, resume feedback sessions, are career oriented (and hackathons are both that and a ton of fun), we have a bunch that are just a lot of fun!
						<br><br>
						We have plenty of volunteering opportunities and encourage you to get involved in whatever interests you (developing for other organizations, introducing elementary computer science concepts to children, teaching prison inmates technical skills, etc).
