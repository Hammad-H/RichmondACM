			<h1>This Semester's ACM Projects</h1>

			<div id="main-container">
				This semester, we're doing a general project structure where we do not assign project managers off the bat, but a member of the ACM exec board will kick off each individual project and help with the setup process. Remember that the projects will only be as much or as little as you put into them, and also remember that they look amazing on resumes if you complete them or do substantial work on them. This project structure is intended to reward those who do work and also not let the project progress be affected much if people drop out.<hr/>

						<h2> // App Development</h2>
						<p class="col">For app development, we already have a project in mind, but this project is open to changing if someone has a better idea. Typically, people have trouble coming up with feasible app ideas, so we have this one as a backup. However, you will be able to choose your platform - Android or iOS! Maybe we'll have two different app development groups for the same project, one focusing on Android and one focusing on iOS.</p>

						<h2> // Web Development</h2>
						<p>For web development, we already have a project planned out for making the ACM website for UR. If you have some bigger or better idea, you can submit that in the additional info on the form or email nasheya.rahman@richmond.edu about it! You may be able to get an additional web development group going, but the ACM website will definitely be one of the projects.</p>

						<h2> // Machine Learning</h2>
						<p>For machine learning, you will have Dr. Arnold as a mentor to help if you get stuck, but we will be providing introductory materials to help you get started!</p>

						<h2> // Data Science/Analytics</h2>
						<p>For data science, you will be using either Python or R, and you will be analyzing a data set of your choosing (hence, the point of data science!). ACM will provide some introductory materials to data science to get you started, and if you get stuck, you will also have Dr. Arnold available as a mentor to help. </p>
